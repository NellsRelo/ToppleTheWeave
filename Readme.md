Volothamp Geddarm is timeless. Literally. After the Spellplague, Mystra and Elminster worked together to make an anchor to keep the Weave stable, and they chose the most unlikely thing possible: An incredibly foolhardy Wizard and Bard, best known as Volo. If Volo dies, the Weave goes with him, making all of reality highly unstable as a result.

Mechanically speaking, if Volo dies, **anyone** who casts a spell will be inflicted with a variation of Wild Magic, which will proc 100% of the time. This mod is compatible with mods that add to the Wild Magic table, and is best enjoyed with as many possibilities as possible. 

In the future, additional surprise effects may happen as well.

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
