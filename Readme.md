Volothamp Geddarm is timeless. Literally. After the Spellplague, Mystra and Elminster worked together to make an anchor to keep the Weave stable, and they chose the most unlikely thing possible: An incredibly foolhardy Wizard and Bard, best known as Volo. If Volo dies, the Weave goes with him, making all of reality highly unstable as a result.

Mechanically speaking, if Volo dies, **anyone** who casts a spell will be inflicted with a variation of Wild Magic, which will proc 100% of the time. This mod is compatible with mods that add to the Wild Magic table, and is best enjoyed with as many possibilities as possible. 

In addition, you have a high chance of one of the following occurring:

- The damage type for a spell that deals damage may permanently change (not reflected in tooltip)
- Money (between 1 and 1000) appears in your bag
- Money (up to 100) is removed from your bag
- Your turn immediately ends
- Your equipped item is unequipped
- You are affected by a Random Status
- A Random Projectile spell fires upon you
- An Random Explosion occurs, centered on you
- Your character immediately dies
- All your cooldowns are reset
- A Random Surface is created under your feet
- A Random Pool Surface is created under your feet
- Your Tadpole Powers are lost
- You forget the spell you cast
- All your summons are dispelled

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
